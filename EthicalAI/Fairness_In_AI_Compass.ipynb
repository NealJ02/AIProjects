        "\n",
        "In the second of this series of notebooks, we'll be exploring various definitions of fairness in AI. We'll continue exploring the COMPAS dataset. In the last notebook, we created a machine learning algorithm that seemed to impact certain groups disproportionately. Can we analyze the fairness of this model more formally, and use those insights to create a better model?\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, we'll assume basic familiarity with Python, basic machine learning concepts, as well as (very) basic knowledge of Pandas (a useful DataFrame processing/data analysis tool). As you go through this notebook, please feel free to add cells for your exploration; however, do keep all the original cells.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Building a competitive model on the COMPAS dataset. \n",
        "2. Analyzing bias and fairness on the COMPAS dataset.\n",
        "3. Exploring and justifying fair models on the COMPAS dataset; discussing fairness in machine learning beyond COMPAS.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "* Learn about probabilistic/mathematical definitions of fairness, and be comfortable evaluating models on these criterion.\n",
        "* Gain skills in commenting on model bias from a statistical and a qualitative standpoint.\n",
        "* Learn topics in model explainability, and gain skills in analyzing models retrospectively.\n",
