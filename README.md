# AIProjects

Contains multiple different AI projects that I have done, all catagorized into three main catagories: Medical AI, Ethical AI, and Gerneral Projects.

Medical AI: These are projects that I have made which can be used in the healthcare field. The folder contains projects which range from disease diagnosis to detecting social distancing. 

Ethical AI: These are projects that I have made which test the bounds of what is ethical and what it unethical in AI. The main goals of these projects are to reduce bias in datasets, protect the privacy of people, and to make more accurate predictions with the least amount of bias in a model.

General Projects: These are general projects that I have done in the AI field which consist of various different types of AI projects.
